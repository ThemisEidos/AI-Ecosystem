# North Star — COOPER Project Direction

> Updated 2026-07-01. Source of truth: PROGRESS.md + PRD.md.

## Current Position

**Step 9 of 9 — Dockerize + Portability**

DoD: `docker compose up` brings COOPER fully online on a fresh checkout.

**Design spec written, NOT yet implemented:** `Docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-01-cooper-dockerize-portability-design.md`. Session paused here 2026-07-02 — next session should confirm the spec (esp. §4, a network-security tradeoff made under a response timeout) before invoking writing-plans.

**⚠️ BRANCH CHECK FIRST:** the branch this project's code lived on (`codex/nightly-task-002-20260606-165602`) was discarded 2026-07-01/02. All work (Steps 1-9) now lives on **`step-9-dockerize`**, recovered from the same tip commit. `main` does not have this code. Run `git branch --show-current` before doing anything — do not assume.

## 9-Step Roadmap

| # | Name | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Conversational runtime (FastAPI + Ollama) | done 2026-06-28 |
| 2 | Decision layer (classifier) | done 2026-06-28, re-verified 2026-06-29/30 |
| 3 | Registry reader + router (Quartermaster) | done 2026-07-01 |
| 4 | Approval gate (Safety Officer) | done 2026-07-01 |
| 5 | Execution gateway + one real tool (Workbench) | done 2026-07-01 |
| 6 | Workshop enforcement (Open vs Private boundary) | done 2026-07-01 |
| 7 | Sub-agent review loop (worker → reviewer → governor) | done 2026-07-01 |
| 8 | Memory + skill loop (SQLite FTS5 + Obsidian brain) | done 2026-07-01 |
| 9 | Dockerize + portability | CURRENT |

## Target Architecture (PRD §4, §9)

Python FastAPI backend + Ollama conversational core + LiteLLM routing + ChromaDB memory + SQLite state.
Open WebUI and n8n retained as client/orchestrator. PowerShell scripts wrapped as callable registry tools.

## Discipline Rule (PRD §10)

Every artifact must RUN, not describe. New standards, policy, or doctrine documents do not count as done. Before declaring any phase done, apply the anti-drift checklist in PRD.md §10.

## What NOT To Do

- Do not retire the PS webhook server (port 8788) until FastAPI is confirmed live in browser UI
- Do not modify PDA-Backups/, Legacy_Docs/, .env, or any file in the CLAUDE.md DO NOT TOUCH list
- Do not run /om-vault-upgrade against this repo
- Do not add features or abstractions beyond the current step's DoD
